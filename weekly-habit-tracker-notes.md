## 🌤 Fasting Windows (Seasonally Adjusted)

- **Standard:** 8 AM – 4 PM
- **Late-night days:** 10 AM – 6 PM
- No meals within 3 hours of bedtime.

---

## 💡 Light Exposure Plan

- **Morning (5–7 AM):** Light box (10,000 lux) or sunrise exposure.
- **Day (9 AM–2 PM):** Outdoor walk minimum 10–15 minutes.
- **Evening (post-8 PM):** Warm / red light only.

---

## 🧘 Evening Routine (8–9 PM)

1. **Guitar Practice (25–30 min)** — low light, minimal screen.
2. **Stretching + Breathing (10–15 min)** — 4s inhale, 6–8s exhale.
3. **Voice Journal (10 min)** — release mental load, close the day.

---

## 💤 Recovery Protocol (for Late Nights)

- Sleep 12–8 AM → sunlight & hydration on waking.
- Gentle activity (sauna, yoga, light walk).
- Avoid caffeine after noon.
- Resume 9 PM sleep next night.

## 🧠 Habit Design & CBT Reinforcement

### Atomic Habits Integration

- **Cue–Routine–Reward Loops:**

  - **Cue:** Keep a visual trigger (e.g., guitar stand visible, journal by bed) to remind you of wind-down rituals.
  - **Routine:** 8 PM stack — guitar → stretch → voice journal.
  - **Reward:** End with a sensory reward (dim light, calming scent, or hot tea) reinforcing the association of rest = pleasure.

- **Environment Design:**

  - Keep screens and work devices out of the bedroom.
  - Prep morning gym clothes and journal the night before — reduce friction.
  - Use smart lighting to auto-dim at 8 PM as a subconscious cue.

- **Identity Shift:** Frame your behavior as identity: _“I’m someone who wakes early, trains, and winds down with music.”_ This keeps the focus on self-concept, not discipline.

### Cognitive Behavioral (CBT) Support

- **Thought Defusion:** If you catch internal resistance ("I’m losing productivity at night"), label it as _a thought, not truth_ — this separates identity from impulse.
- **Reframe:** Instead of _“I can’t stay up late,”_ reframe as _“I choose recovery because it amplifies my performance tomorrow.”_
- **Sleep Anxiety Tool:** If you can’t fall asleep, get out of bed, dimly light, and do light reading or breathing until drowsy. Avoid ruminating in bed.
- **Behavioral Activation:** On groggy mornings, act _before_ motivation arises — light, hydration, movement first. Mood follows action.

### Habit Tracking

- Use a visible checklist or app: tick off daily cues (light exposure, fasting, guitar, journal).
- Reward streaks weekly, not daily, to emphasize consistency over perfection.

## 🧩 Seasonal Anchors

- **Light:** Bright early, dim late.
- **Meals:** Within daylight window.
- **Movement:** Morning or midday.
- **Mind:** Creative descent before bed.

This system merges circadian science with behavioral reinforcement — turning your rhythm from an obligation into an identity loop supported by environment, emotion, and cognition.
